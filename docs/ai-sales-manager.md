## Configuration Options

### Core Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `autoCloseEnabled` | Master switch for auto-closure | `true` |
| `inactivityDays` | Days of inactivity before analysis | `5` |
| `confidenceThreshold` | Minimum AI confidence for actions | `high` |
| `maxTicketsPerBatch` | Tickets processed per run | `50` |

### AI-Specific Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `autoCloseOnlyIfAgentRespondedLast` | Safety: Only close if agent responded last | `true` |
| `minimumConversationTurnsForAI` | Min customer+agent messages for AI | `2` |
| `inactivityDaysForConfidentClosure` | Days for high-confidence closures | `3` |
| `enableAutoFollowUp` | Allow AI to send follow-up questions | `false` |
| `analyzeLowActivityTickets` | Include minimal conversations | `false` |

### Customer Communication

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `sendCustomerNotification` | Notify customers of closures | `true` |
| `includeSurveyLink` | Add satisfaction survey links | `false` |
| `surveyUrl` | Template URL for surveys | `""` |

## AI Analysis Process

### 1. Ticket Eligibility Check

```typescript
// Tickets are eligible if they:
- Are not already closed
- Haven't been updated for X days (configurable)
- Have minimum conversation turns (configurable)
- Meet other safety criteria
```

### 2. Conversation Analysis

The AI analyzes:

- **Issue Resolution**: Are all customer problems addressed?
- **Solution Completeness**: Did agents provide adequate solutions?
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Explicit confirmations or implicit indicators
- **Conversation Flow**: Natural conclusion vs. abandoned conversation
- **Business Context**: Order status, product questions, technical issues

### 3. Decision Framework

```typescript
interface ResolutionAnalysis {
  isResolved: boolean;                    // Core resolution assessment
  confidence: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'; // AI confidence level
  reasonForConclusion: string;           // Detailed reasoning
  resolutionSummary: string;             // How issue was resolved
  recommendedAction: 'close' | 'follow_up' | 'none';
  followUpQuestion?: string;             // AI-generated follow-up
  
  analysisContext: {
    customerRespondedLast: boolean;
    daysSinceLastAgentResponse: number;
    conversationTurns: number;
    hasMultipleIssues: boolean;
    identifiedIssues: string[];
  };
  
  satisfactionIndicators: {
    explicitSatisfaction: boolean;
    expresstionOfGratitude: boolean;
    negativeSentiment: boolean;
    satisfactionConfidence: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  };
}
```

## Example AI Prompts

### High-Quality Analysis Prompt

```
You are an expert Customer Support Manager AI with deep experience in customer service resolution analysis. Your task is to analyze this support ticket conversation and provide a comprehensive assessment.

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. RESOLUTION STATUS: Has the customer's primary issue been fully addressed?
2. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION INDICATORS: Explicit confirmations, gratitude, negative sentiment
3. CONVERSATION CONTEXT: Last responder, timing, conversation flow
4. BUSINESS CONTEXT: Order inquiries, product questions, technical issues

DECISION CRITERIA:
- High confidence: Customer confirmed satisfaction OR complete solution + 3+ days no response
- Medium confidence: Likely resolved but no explicit confirmation
- Low confidence: Unclear or potentially unresolved issues
```

## Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Pre-Analysis Filters

- Minimum conversation requirements
- Recent activity checks
- Customer response timing
- Multiple issue detection

### 2. Decision Safeguards

- Confidence threshold enforcement
- Agent-last-response requirement
- Negative sentiment detection
- Sufficient inactivity periods

### 3. Post-Action Monitoring

- Customer reopen tracking
- Accuracy measurement
- Performance analytics
- Manual override capabilities

## API Endpoints

### Configuration Management

```bash
# Get current configuration
GET /api/admin/resolution-config

# Update configuration
POST /api/admin/resolution-config
```

### Manual Triggers

```bash
# Process tickets manually
GET /api/cron/process-resolutions

# Get performance metrics
GET /api/admin/resolution-metrics

# List auto-resolved tickets
GET /api/admin/resolved-tickets
```

## Cron Job Setup

### Vercel Cron (vercel.json)

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/process-resolutions",
      "schedule": "0 */6 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
CRON_SECRET=your_secure_cron_secret
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics

- **AI Accuracy**: Percentage of auto-closed tickets not reopened
- **Confidence Distribution**: High/medium/low confidence breakdown
- **Conversation Analysis**: Average turns before closure
- **Follow-Up Effectiveness**: Success rate of AI-generated questions
- **Processing Volume**: Tickets analyzed vs. actions taken

### Admin Dashboard Features

- Real-time configuration management
- Visual performance metrics
- Detailed audit logs
- Manual override capabilities
- Reopen tracking and analysis

## Best Practices

### 1. Configuration Tuning

- Start with conservative settings (high confidence only)
- Monitor reopen rates closely
- Adjust thresholds based on business needs
- Test with limited ticket volumes initially

### 2. Performance Optimization

- Use appropriate batch sizes to avoid API limits
- Monitor Gemini API costs and usage
- Implement rate limiting for API calls
- Cache configuration to reduce database calls

### 3. Quality Assurance

- Regularly review auto-closed tickets
- Track customer feedback and complaints
- Monitor false positive rates
- Maintain human oversight capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High False Positive Rate**
   - Increase confidence threshold
   - Enable agent-last-response requirement
   - Increase minimum conversation turns

2. **Low AI Utilization**
   - Decrease inactivity day requirements
   - Enable low-activity ticket analysis
   - Lower confidence thresholds

3. **API Rate Limits**
   - Reduce batch sizes
   - Increase processing intervals
   - Implement exponential backoff

### Error Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive logging:

```typescript
// Monitor these log patterns
"Resolution Agent: AI analysis complete"
"Resolution Agent: Ticket auto-closed"
"Resolution Agent: Error processing ticket"
```

## Cost Considerations

### Gemini API Usage

- Approximately 1000-1500 tokens per ticket analysis
- Costs vary by model (gemini-1.5-flash recommended for cost efficiency)
- Monitor usage through Google Cloud Console
- Set billing alerts and quotas

### Optimization Strategies

- Use flash model for routine analysis
- Batch process during off-peak hours
- Cache analysis results appropriately
- Implement intelligent pre-filtering
