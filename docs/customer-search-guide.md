# Elegant Customer Search Guide for Phone Conversations 📞

## Overview

When you're on the phone with a customer trying to send them a quote, finding their information quickly and elegantly is crucial. Our enhanced customer search system provides multiple intelligent search methods that work perfectly for phone conversations, with **automatic ShipStation backup search** when customers aren't found in Shopify.

## 🎯 Quick Search Methods

### 1. **Order Number Search** (Fastest & Most Reliable)
- **When to use**: Customer mentions they have an order number
- **Examples**: 
  - `1234` (simple number)
  - `#5678` (with hash)
  - `order 9101` (with word "order")
  - `113-9584588-3153007` (Amazon format)

**Phone Script**: *"Do you happen to have an order number from a previous purchase? That's the fastest way for me to pull up your information."*

### 2. **Phone Number Search** (Great for Returning Customers)
- **When to use**: Customer provides their phone number
- **Formats handled automatically** (no special symbols needed!):
  - `5551234567` (just the digits)
  - `555-123-4567`
  - `555.123.4567`
  - `555 123 4567`
  - `(555) 123-4567`
  - `15551234567` (with country code)

**Phone Script**: *"What's your phone number?"* (They can say it any way - the system figures it out!)

### 3. **Email Search** (Professional & Accurate)
- **When to use**: For business customers or when they mention email
- **Examples**: `john@company.com`, `support@acme.corp`
- **🆕 NEW**: If not found in Shopify, automatically searches ShipStation!

**Phone Script**: *"What email address do you use for business? I can search by that."*

### 4. **Name Search** (Personal Touch)
- **When to use**: When other methods don't work
- **Searches**: First name, last name, or both
- **Examples**: `John Smith`, `Sarah`, `Johnson`
- **🆕 NEW**: If not found in Shopify, automatically searches ShipStation!

**Phone Script**: *"Let me try searching by your name. How do you spell your first and last name?"*

## 🚀 Smart Auto-Detection

The system automatically detects what type of search you're performing:

- **Numbers** (4+ digits) → Order number search
- **Phone patterns** → Phone number search  
- **Contains @** → Email search
- **Text only** → Name search

## 🔄 **NEW: Automatic ShipStation Backup Search**

### What It Does:
When a customer isn't found in Shopify, the system **automatically** searches ShipStation as a backup. This is perfect for:

- **Existing customers** who have ordered before but aren't in Shopify yet
- **Customers with address information** stored in ShipStation
- **Historical order data** that might not be synced

### Visual Indicators:
- **🟢 Shopify Badge**: Customer found in main Shopify database
- **🔵 ShipStation Badge**: Customer found via backup ShipStation search
- **⚠️ Address Warning**: ShipStation customer without complete address info

### How It Works:
1. **Primary Search**: System searches Shopify first (fastest)
2. **Automatic Fallback**: If no results, searches ShipStation
3. **Address Extraction**: Pulls customer details from latest ShipStation order
4. **Smart Conversion**: Converts ShipStation data to work with quote system

## 📞 Phone Conversation Flow

### Recommended Order of Questions:

1. **Start with Order Number**: "Do you have an order number handy?"
2. **Try Phone Number**: "What's your phone number?"
3. **Ask for Email**: "What email address did you use?"
4. **Get Their Name**: "Can you spell your name for me?"

### Example Phone Script:

```
"Hi! I'm going to help you with that quote. To pull up your information quickly, 
do you happen to have an order number from any previous purchases?"

→ If yes: Type the order number
→ If no: "No problem! What's the best phone number to reach you?"
→ If no luck: "What email address do you typically use?"
→ Final fallback: "Let me search by your name..."

💡 NEW: "Great! I found you in our system. I can see your previous order 
history and shipping address to make this quote faster!"
```
