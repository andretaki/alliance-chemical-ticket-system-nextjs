# Development Workflow Integration

This document outlines the integrated development workflow for the Alliance Chemical Ticket System, combining the structured AI-assisted development pipeline with local testing capabilities.

## Current Status

âœ… **Completed Setup:**
- Production-ready Vercel configuration with security headers
- Docker Compose for local development (PostgreSQL, Redis, MailHog)
- Jest testing framework with Next.js integration
- Playwright E2E testing setup
- Environment configuration templates
- Database initialization scripts

## Development Environment Setup

### 1. Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start local development environment
npm run dev:setup

# Reset development environment (clean slate)
npm run dev:reset

# Stop development environment
npm run dev:stop
```

### 2. Available Services

When you run `npm run dev:setup`, you get:
- **PostgreSQL** (localhost:5432) - Development database
- **PostgreSQL Test** (localhost:5433) - Test database
- **Redis** (localhost:6379) - KV storage
- **MailHog** (localhost:8025) - Email testing interface
- **Next.js App** (localhost:3001) - Your application

### 3. Testing Commands

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## AI-Assisted Development Pipeline

### Stage 1: REQUEST (Idea Refinement)
- Collaborate on developing/refining project concepts
- Transform basic ideas into comprehensive requirements
- Output: Structured project request in Markdown

### Stage 2: SPEC (Technical Specification)
- Generate comprehensive technical specifications
- Cover architecture, features, data flows, integrations
- Output: Detailed technical spec for implementation

### Stage 3: PLANNER (Implementation Planning)
- Create step-by-step implementation plans
- Break down complex features into manageable tasks
- Output: Ordered checklist of implementation steps

### Stage 4: CODEGEN (Code Generation)
- Systematically implement features step-by-step
- Generate complete, documented code files
- Output: Production-ready code with comprehensive documentation

### Stage 5: REVIEW (Code Review & Optimization)
- Analyze existing code against requirements
- Identify improvements and optimizations
- Output: Optimization plan for code quality improvements

## Integrated Workflow

### For New Features

1. **Define Requirements** using REQUEST stage
2. **Create Technical Spec** using SPEC stage
3. **Generate Implementation Plan** using PLANNER stage
4. **Implement Code** using CODEGEN stage
5. **Test Locally** using provided testing setup
6. **Review & Optimize** using REVIEW stage
7. **Deploy to Vercel** (production-ready configuration)

### For Bug Fixes

1. **Identify Issue** through local testing or reports
2. **Create Fix Plan** using PLANNER stage
3. **Implement Fix** using CODEGEN stage
4. **Test Fix** using local testing setup
5. **Deploy to Vercel**

## Project-Specific Context

The workflow uses your `CLAUDE.md` file as the **PROJECT_RULES** input, ensuring all development follows:
- Alliance Chemical system architecture
- Database schema conventions
- API design patterns
- Security practices
- Code style guidelines

## Next Steps

Ready to start coding! We can:

1. **Fix existing issues** - Identify and resolve current problems
2. **Add new features** - Use the full pipeline to implement new functionality
3. **Optimize performance** - Use REVIEW stage to improve existing code
4. **Enhance testing** - Add more comprehensive test coverage
